        <h5><strong>Open Source Software at the Lab</strong></h5>
        <p>Berkeley Lab is managed by The Regents of the University of
          California (&ldquo;The Regents&rdquo;) under a contract between U.S.
          Department of Energy (&ldquo;DOE&rdquo;) and The Regents. By virtue
          of the University of California&rsquo;s (&ldquo;UC&rdquo;)
          systemwide intellectual property policies as well as delegations of
          authority starting from The Regents to the UC President (e.g., The
          Regents&rsquo; Standing Order 100.4), Berkeley Lab is authorized to
          grant licenses or transfer its rights in intellectual property (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;)
          owned by The Regents, but only to the extent that such IP rights are
          within the control and jurisdiction of Berkeley Lab and subject to
          DOE regulations. </p>
        <p>Therefore, Berkeley Lab may not grant licenses or otherwise
          encumber any patents, copyrights, or trademarks created at and under
          the control and jurisdiction of another UC campus (and vice-versa),
          without the other campus&rsquo;s consent. A license grant of IP
          rights beyond the delegated authority violates UC&rsquo;s policies
          and standing orders, and is considered by UC to be invalid and
          unenforceable.</p>
        <p>The specific limited delegated authority granted to UC locations
          for IP matters means that Berkeley Lab can bind only itself
          regarding IP licenses, including open source software (&ldquo;OSS&rdquo;)
          licenses. Some OSS licenses – notably <a
                  href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">General
            Public License version 3</a> and <a
                  href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache
            License version 2.0</a> – contain a patent license requiring each
          contributor to software licensed under such OSS licenses to provide
          a royalty-free, irrevocable license to others for any relevant
          patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor. Such licenses
          are usually intended to bind the legal entity whose employees are
          contributing to or publicly distributing the OSS project. Because
          the legal entity for Berkeley Lab may be considered The Regents,
          absent the limited delegated authority for patents, the possible
          effect of Berkeley Lab entering into such patent-granting OSS
          licenses might be that all relevant patents owned by The Regents
          (not just those within control of Berkeley Lab) would be encumbered.
          To this point, The Regents considers such licenses as voidable
          and/or unenforceable to the extent the license requires a particular
          campus or unit of The Regents to agree to a covenant beyond the
          scope of that campus&rsquo;s or unit&rsquo;s delegated authority. In
          other words, the official with appropriate delegated authority at
          Berkeley Lab can agree to an &ldquo;open&rdquo; patent license for
          only any relevant patents within Berkeley Lab&rsquo;s jurisdiction,
          but not for any other patents owned or controlled by The Regents.
        </p>
        <p>It is, therefore, important to involve the appropriate official
          with delegated authority at Berkeley Lab before entering into OSS
          licenses for IP owned by The Regents and under the control and
          jurisdiction of Berkeley Lab. At Berkeley Lab, that official is the
          Chief Technology Transfer Officer, currently Russell Carrington who
          leads the <a href="http://ipo.lbl.gov/">Intellectual Property
            Office</a> (IPO). Any IP created at Berkeley Lab or by Berkeley
          Lab employees is likely owned by The Regents and must be formally
          reported to IPO before&nbsp;the technology is distributed or
          licensed to anyone outside of Berkeley Lab, even if it is to be
          distributed for free or via an OSS license. Among other things, the
          purposes of such reporting are to ensure that, prior to
          distribution: (1) Berkeley Lab has the appropriate rights and
          authority to license or otherwise distribute the software; (2) the
          OSS license is appropriate for the software and its contemplated
          distribution; and (3) Berkeley Lab is in compliance with its DOE
          requirements. </p>
        <p>For questions about this notice, please contact Berkeley Lab's
          IPO: <a href="mailto:ipo@lbl.gov">ipo@lbl.gov</a>.

          spaces and in those accompanying IP spaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy
          also applies to LBL owned assets whether or not they are on LBL
