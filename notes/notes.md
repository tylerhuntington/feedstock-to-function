# Search
- Compound filters
- Checkbox for predicted vs experimental

- make the search by property to dropdown
- fewer options 

# Check in with Vi 04-20-21

- activity code 2 on LETS

Less Urgent:
- blending interface with a few sample molecules as options with Jet A
- Pick one molecule and blend it with Jet A at 5, 10 15, 20, 50 percent blend

Tasks:
[x] carousel on landing page for each tool on site
[x] Hit enter to search
[x] All molecules as a dropdown option to Search By dropdown and auto open first filter
[x] If theres experimental value, ignore predicted with "Include Predictions" checkbox
[x] Layout of results:
  [x] two tables: experimentally measured and predicted
  [x] get rid of estimator column, just one link to a page with all algo info
  [x] Separate sources by delimiter
  [x] make property names light gray in predicted table like values
[x] About Page: new photos without titles - Vi will provide
[x] DB stats, delete experimental and only show predicted values
[x] Make page for "Design Blend" in navbar after Molecule Explorer with coming soon bannerd
[x] Documentation and API tabs as an iframe with a button to open in new window
[x] prevent removal of a filter when searching all molecs
[x] clear search term box when search by all molecs selected
[x] add properties columns in search results
[x] add component properties columns in blend results
[x] add morgans blend data
[x] add BETO attribution to footer.

[-o] Add some text to top of Molecule Explorer to describe what it does.

[x] update chemical properties with Ana's new dataset
[x] add OTF prediction for smiles search for smiles not in db
[x] move smiles to left most column in search results
[x] make smiles hyperlinked in search results
[x] get chemical form submissions working with notification by email
[x] get blend form submissions working with notification by email
[x] weird issue with search by name e.g. farnesane and IUPAC name
